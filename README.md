# YUM Staking

## Overview

The YUMStaking contract is designed to allow users to stake a specific ERC20 token (referred to as the asset) and receive shares in return. These shares represent the user's stake in the contract and can be redeemed for the underlying asset at any time. The contract ensures secure and efficient handling of deposits, mints, withdrawals, and redemptions, providing a reliable staking mechanism for users. Maximum deposit and mint limits are set to the maximum possible value, allowing flexibility for users. The contract ensures accurate conversion between assets and shares and includes security features to protect user funds.
